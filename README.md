# Fungi-ITS-analyses
This repository contains two files. 1) A file describing the steps followed to analyse ITS data for the manuscript "Fungal diversity in shade-coffee plantations in Soconusco, Mexico: impact on orchid conservation"; 2) A script that executes a cutadapt loop to remove adapters from raw ITS sequences.
